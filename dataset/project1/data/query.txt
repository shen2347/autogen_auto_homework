I've been going here for years and it has never disappointed. Best biang biang noodles in Seattle 
(or more!). I've introduced friends from out of state and they've all loved it. If you like thick, 
chewy, "qq" noodles I will always recommend Xi'an noodles.

My favorite is the spicy cumin lamb dry noodles! Delicious cumin flavor and the right amount of 
heat. I don't have a high spice tolerance and this is perfect for me. Tip: eat IMMEDIATELY after you 
get it. If you let this sit out for more than 15 minutes it will not be good! Same goes for 
refrigeration--do not save this for later as it will be awful. My boyfriend goes even further to 
say: "If you don't eat this in the first 30 seconds, you've missed out!"
